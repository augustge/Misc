IDEAS FOR PROJECTS

### Fractals
  choose iterations
  line, triangle, square, etc

### Galaxy formation
  draw mass density field approximated by lattice
  Newtonian gravity acts on mass of each lattice point
  * radiation pressure
  * clumping into larger objects
  * luminous vs dark

### Action
  Animate motion along discretized paths
  show "clock" to visualize action along the path
